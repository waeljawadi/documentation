notify child from parent



in childComponent.ts

@Input() private uploadSuccess: EventEmitter<boolean>;
Additionally in childComponent.ts subscribe to the event:

ngOnInit() {
  if (this.uploadSuccess) {
    this.uploadSuccess.subscribe(data => {
      // Do something in the childComponent after parent emits the event.
    });
  }
}



Parent Component
In ParentComponent.html

<app-gallery  [uploadSuccess] = "uploadSuccess" > </app-gallery>



In ParentComponent.ts

private uploadSuccess: EventEmitter<boolean> = new EventEmitter();

onImageUploadSuccess(event) {
   console.log('Image Upload succes');
   if (event.code === 'OK' && this.maxUploadLimit > 0) {
      this.galleryImagesCount = this.galleryImagesCount + 1;
      this.maxUploadLimit = this.maxUploadLimit - 1;
    }

   // The parent emits the event which was given as `@Input` variable to the child-component
   this.uploadSuccess.emit(true);
